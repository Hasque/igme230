        <h5> A concise description of the intended audience(s) and goal(s) for your site, including your expectation of how, when, and why they would be accessing your site. (Can be copied from proposal, or updated if it changed.)</h5>
        <p>I only expect myself and recruiters to visit my website. They will most likely visit my website on their laptop. They will access my website to see my work and what I'm interested in. I chose not to put in school projects because they aren't 
        relevant to the work I want to do. This approach has been successful because Instagram offered me a job because of my personal drive.

        <h5> Sketches or grid-based wireframes, showing how you designed the grid layouts for each of your page types and placed content within them. (Can be copied from proposal, or updated if it changed.)</h5>
        <img src="images/wireframes.png" class="responsive-image">
        <h5>A clear explanation of why you made the design decisions that you did, including your choices of images, colors, and typefaces. These should all relate back to the goal of your design.</h5>
        <p> Every design portfolio has a basic grid with no personality. I choose to steer away from the convential choices by having more of a personality.I chose Roboto because everyone else is choosing typefaces other than Roboto. The goal was to steer away from convential choices. </p>

        <h5>A full list of sources for all elements used on the site that you did not create yourself, with the exception of web-based typefaces. This includes images and code samples. If you modified the original resource, you should explain what changes you made to it (if any).</h5>
        <p>http://getskeleton.com/ - It was helping me understand basic structure of making a website. Things like Typescae rem and em values. </p>

        <p>http://getskeleton.com/ - This helped me with type sizes and font spacing. I learned that there's a lot more than just making an HTML document. Helped me understand the concept of normalizing css (Makes your website more consistent betweeen browsers). I was just going through the documentation and helped me think
            more systematically while designing for websites </p>
